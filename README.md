## Day 1: A Grand Beginning (30th July, 2025)
â€‹The induction program for 2025 began on a spiritual and formal note. We started the day with a serene Shabad Kirtan in the college gurdwara, a peaceful way to set a positive tone. This was followed by a brief break for tea and snacks, allowing everyone to mingle and settle in before the main event. At 10 a.m., the inaugural ceremony officially kicked off in the college auditorium. We were honored to hear from several key figures, including our esteemed Principal, Dr. Sehajpal Singh, and the Head of the Applied Sciences Department, Harpreet Kaur Ma'am, both of whom shared inspiring words. The ceremony's highlight was the address by our Chief Guest, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, who offered a motivating speech to welcome us into the college community. The day truly set a high standard for the week ahead, making us feel welcomed and excited for our new academic journey.
